# Project Purpose

**Wikipefia** is a project focused on improving the quality of the educational process at the university. Its main goal is to provide top-quality, human-centered learning materials for students and simplify collaboration in the learning process.

The core objective of the project is to gather all the information accumulated by generations of students and written by teachers, and present it in a simple and accessible form.

# Wikipefia Principles

### Accessibility
All materials on the portal are provided in the most open and accessible way possible, minimizing the student's effort spent on searching for and processing information. The platform is built so that finding materials becomes second nature. The portal structure is designed for maximum speed and consistency of content. Everything is always in its place, fast and accessible.

### Interactivity
Articles on Wikipefia are not just text. One of our goals is to ensure that students actively engage with learning materials. Wikipefia's architecture is designed so that each article is an interactive platform where students engage with content through many interactive widgets that help them understand material in practice.

### Structured Consistency
Each subject on Wikipefia has a clearly defined structure, adjusted to its specifics. For students, this means stability. Every article and every page is designed to maximize consistency. No matter what subject a student studies, everything on Wikipefia is exactly where the student expects it to be: no surprises, no extra mental load. The focus is exclusively on understanding and learning.

### Automation
Wikipefia's architecture and content-creation tools — the Wikipefia Creator Kit — allow authors to focus on the creative process of building materials while minimizing the need to think about how Wikipefia works under the hood. Built-in AI assistants will do the heavy lifting for you; you only need to apply your creativity to writing clear and engaging educational material.

### Individualization
Articles on Wikipefia are created with each student's individual abilities and progress in mind. We aim to help you at every stage of preparation: from moments when you try to learn the whole subject overnight before an exam to gradual learning throughout the semester. From the most curious and disciplined to the busiest and most behind students. We respect every learning style and believe that even the most unmotivated or overloaded student deserves a fair chance to pass exams with respect for their time and abilities.

# Our Mission

**A bit of history about why Wikipefia was created.**
*You can skip this block if you're not interested in the fundamental reasons behind the portal.*

Here I want to address you personally. Hi, my name is Ilya, I am the founder of Wikipefia. I am writing this article before the portal release, during the early planning phase of the project. The idea to create Wikipefia came to me more than a year ago. During this year, the concept and development process of this project went through many ups and downs, and I still strongly believe the project will sooner or later come to life and benefit many generations of students at PEF CZU and students at other universities.

At one point I realized this: most teachers in educational institutions do not have a fundamental goal of creating learning materials that are truly engaging and interesting. They are focused on formal requirements, science, and their personal lives. I deeply respect this reality; it is an essential part of the academic system without which universities could not exist. However, the need for student collaboration and high-quality educational materials always exists, and in my view, sooner or later there must be a place where every proactive student can contribute so that future generations no longer have to go through the pain of collecting needed information piece by piece.

Wikipefia is a place where the phenomenal expertise of talented teachers and the initiative of committed students come together to create something genuinely new. Something that turns dry fundamental science into an exciting educational adventure. Something that gives hope for quality education even to the most indifferent students and finally removes the educational barrier, turning the most "lazy but capable" into truly excellent students.

I want my project to unite all students — with different learning approaches, different talents, different ways of perceiving and remembering information, and different amounts of available time — and help all of us become people who **love learning** and do it not for appearances, not just to "cram" material, but because we are genuinely interested.

The fundamental mission of Wikipefia is to give every student the right to sincerely **love** learning.

Thank you for staying with us and believing in the project.

*Sincerely yours, creator of Wikipefia,*
*Ilya.*
