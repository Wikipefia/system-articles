## Core Subjects

Your first semester includes foundational courses that set the stage for everything that follows:

<Tabs>
<Tab label="Linear Algebra">
**Credits**: 5 ECTS | **Difficulty**: Medium | **Instructor**: Prof. Ivan Petrov

Vector spaces, matrices, determinants, and linear transformations. This course gives you the mathematical tools used across all computational disciplines.

**Key topics**: Vector operations, matrix algebra, eigenvalues, diagonalization.
</Tab>

<Tab label="Programming Fundamentals">
**Credits**: 5 ECTS | **Difficulty**: Easy-Medium | **Instructor**: Dr. Maria Novakova

Python programming, data structures, and algorithmic thinking. You'll go from writing your first `print("Hello")` to implementing sorting algorithms and working with graphs.

**Key topics**: Variables, loops, functions, recursion, basic data structures.
</Tab>

<Tab label="Discrete Mathematics">
**Credits**: 6 ECTS | **Difficulty**: Medium | **Instructors**: Prof. Petrov & Dr. Novakova

Logic, combinatorics, graph theory, and recurrence relations. The mathematical backbone of computer science.

**Key topics**: Propositional logic, sets, proof techniques, counting, graphs.

## Tips for Success

<Collapse title="1. Attend every lecture">
Lectures build on each other. Missing one creates a snowball effect. If you must miss a lecture, get notes from a classmate and visit office hours.
</Collapse>

<Collapse title="2. Start problem sets early">
Most students underestimate how long problem sets take. Start the day they're assigned, not the night before they're due.
</Collapse>

<Collapse title="3. Use Wikipefia actively">
Every subject has articles that supplement the lectures. Use them for review, exam prep, and deeper understanding of topics that weren't clear in class.
</Collapse>

<Collapse title="4. Form study groups">
Studies consistently show that students who work in groups perform better than solo studiers. Explaining concepts to others is the most effective way to learn.
