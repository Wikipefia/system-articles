# Frequently Asked Questions

<Collapse title="What is Wikipefia?">
Wikipefia is an educational portal for university students. It provides academic articles organized by subject and teacher, with full-text search, multilingual support, and interactive content like quizzes and code playgrounds.
</Collapse>

<Collapse title="Who writes the articles?">
Articles are written by professors, teaching assistants, and approved contributors. Each article credits its author and goes through a review process before publication.
</Collapse>

<Collapse title="How do I change the language?">
Click the language switcher in the top navigation bar. Your preference is saved in a cookie, so it persists across visits. Available languages: Russian, English, Czech.
</Collapse>

<Collapse title="Why is some content not available in my language?">
Not all articles have been translated into every language yet. When content isn't available in your preferred language, the site shows the next best version (English, then Russian) with a notice at the top.
</Collapse>

<Collapse title="How does the search work?">
Press **Cmd+K** (Mac) or **Ctrl+K** (Windows) to open search. The search index includes all subject names, teacher names, article titles, descriptions, and keywords. It runs entirely in your browser — no data is sent to a server.
</Collapse>

<Collapse title="Can I contribute content?">
Yes! Each subject and teacher has its own GitHub repository. You can submit corrections or new content via pull requests. See the contribution guidelines in each repository's README.
</Collapse>

<Collapse title="How are teacher ratings calculated?">
Teacher ratings are aggregated from anonymous student surveys collected at the end of each semester. Ratings cover four dimensions: overall impression, clarity of explanation, difficulty level, and practical usefulness.
</Collapse>

<Collapse title="How often is content updated?">
Content is updated continuously. When an author pushes changes to their repository, the site rebuilds automatically within minutes. Major updates typically happen at the start of each semester.
</Collapse>

<Collapse title="Is there a mobile app?">
Not yet, but the website is fully responsive and works well on mobile devices. You can add it to your home screen for an app-like experience.
</Collapse>

<Collapse title="I found an error in an article. How do I report it?">
Each article's source is available on GitHub. You can open an issue or submit a pull request with the correction. Alternatively, contact the article's author directly via their profile page.
